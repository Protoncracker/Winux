# **What is Winux? How Can It Be Utilized?**

Winux aims to augment your operational control over your operating system. It offers versatile, open-source tools that eliminate the need for extraneous installations like interpreters. Furthermore, the code base is highly modifiable to suit your specific needs. The project also has an educational aspect, introducing users to offensive security through controlled environments and interactive minigames, all of which feature customized scoring systems and rewards.

To get started, navigate to the [official Winux project page](https://github.com/Protoncracker/Winux). Here, you'll find `packages.zip`, which contains optional third-party add-ons, and the central program, `main.bat`. Run `main.bat` for a guided installation process through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or use "main.bat install" in CMD for automated installation.

Within `main.bat`, the `help` command will display an integrated list of system and available commands. To see custom commands exclusive to your version of Winux, use "help main".
